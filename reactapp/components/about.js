              I am currently a senior at San Francisco State University,
              studying computer science. My passion is building scalable backend
              services and I have extensive experience using Node.js to do so.
              In addition to Node.js, I also enjoy working with Python and Go to
              create backend services. I have some experience working on the
              frontend and have created a few projects using React.

              My greatest strengths are that I approach every situation with an
              open mind and am eager to learn new things.

              In my free time I like to go on hikes, watch Formula 1, and spend
              time with my friends. I also try to workout and partake in sim
              racing whenever I get the chance.{" "}
